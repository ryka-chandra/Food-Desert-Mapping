# Food-Desert-Mapping
This project analyzes food access and population data across Washington State by merging census data with food access data. Using GeoPandas and Matplotlib, the project visualizes various aspects of the data, such as population distribution, food access by county, and low-access census tracts. The goal is to understand the geographic distribution of food accessibility and demographic patterns across Washington State.
